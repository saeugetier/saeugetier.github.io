When I visited the local hackerspace, I saw some guy engraving signitures on a silicon wafer as a gift before going into retirement. I found that a nice idea and as my colleague was short before retirement, I searched on eBay for some wafers and was lucky. This idea turned quickly into some bigger project. I thought, what if I can build a clock with clock-face made from a silicon wafer? And as every cool project has LEDs, the clock should have LEDs, too. 

In Germany we have radio controlled clocks fed by a radio protocoll DCF77. There are ready analog clock modules for DIY projects. These clock module have several test pads not covered by the housing. My first guess was, that the demodulated radio signal was on of that pads. I ordered one from Amazon and started to look for signals, I can use to decode a timestamp. This timestamp than can be used to synchronize the LEDs with the analog clock. 

Unfortunately my clock module had the DCF77 not on one of the pads which was easily to access. But when probing on additional pads covered below the housing, I found that demodulated signals.

The whole clock module runs from a single AA battery. So the logic level of all digital signals is 1,2 to 1,5V. I first hooked up an oszilloscope. After I found promissing cadidates, I soldered some wires and plugged into a simple Cypress FX2 logic analyzer, which can be used with Sigrok. The FX2 microcontroller on the logic analyzer expects 3,3V. For adjusting the logic levels, I had to apply a bias voltage to the ground. 0.7V was just right enough.

PulseView directly records every sample into RAM memory. So doing long time measurements will be memory intensive. Sigrok can write write measurements into VCD files, which only record data, when a signal level has changed. This results into smaller memory consumption. VCD files can be open by a lot of different viewer programs. 

Doing a long time measurement of the DCF77 clock module showed, that the radio receiver is only activly receiving every 3 hours. The length of the demodulated signal is about 3 minutes. So there is enough data for decoding a timestamp and the clock of the LED driver can be not 100% precise. The time of the internal clock in the microcontroller can be synchronized a few times a day.

With that results, the plans are evolving. We have a clock module, which is self powered by a AA battery and we know where the demodulated radio signal is. The idea was, to power the LEDs by the same battery as the clock module. With that idea I searched for electronic components, which match my requirements. I need some kind of low power boost converter for converting 1.5V to LED power supply and logic supply.

My choice was:
* Boost converter [TPS610986](https://www.ti.com/product/TPS610986): Low power boost converter with 3.3V output voltage and minimum 0.7V input voltage. 
* Microcontroller [STM32G031](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32g031k8.html): ST just started the new STM32G series microcontroller. These microcontrollers were further optimized for low power usage and have the newest revision of peripherals, which allow low power operation. The Cortex-M0+ core is very power efficient. 
* Addressable LEDs [WS2812B](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf): The WS2812B are very commonly used addressable RGB Leds. The color of each LED can be set via one data line. The LEDs are functioning as a shift register. Data is shifted the next LED in the row when data is continiously streamed via data pin. The datasheet say, that the operating voltage is from 3.5V to 5.3V, but in my case they used worked fine at 3.3V.
* Level shifter from 1.5V to 3.3V signals: simple grounded emitter transistor circuit. The signals from the clock module is 0V when idle. So no current is flowing on idle.

With that choices where made, a [schematic](https://github.com/saeugetier/LedDcfClockHardware/blob/main/lowpower.pdf) was created and the PCB was desigend.

The PCB is designed with small size in mind. Components are SMD parts for the most parts. SMD resistors have 0603 size for being small, but still easy for hand soldering. I ordered a laser cut solder paste stencil in order to place the right amound of soldering paste.

Kicad is able to export an 3d Model of the assembled PCB, which then can be loaded into Fusion360. On GrabCAD I found a ready to use model of the DCF77 clock module. So I could model the whole clock housing and see if everything fits.

While I waited for the electronic components and PCBs to arrive, I started with the [firmware](https://github.com/saeugetier/LedDcfClock) in parallel. The firmware is written from scratch in C++. My goal was to try some complete object oriented design of the firmware. A small operating system and even the peripheral drivers were written in C++. The peripheral drivers are implemented on top of the STM's Low Level peripheral abstraction layer, which allows to use the peripherals with very low overhead. Low amount of instructions in firmware will help in lower execution times and therefore less energy to be consumed.

In order to save energy clever use of the STM32G0 power saving features is necessary. The STM32G0 uses the most energy while the CPU is fully running and all needed peripherals are turned on. The CPU doesn't need to run all the time. The most of the times it is waiting for the next event. So setting the CPU into sleep mode, while nothing has to be computed, it very handy. Peripherals will quickly wake up the CPU from sleep mode by hardware interrupts. In order to safe even more energy, the CPU can be set into stop mode. In stop mode the core will loose the content of the RAM and the execution of the program will start from the very first instruction, after the processor was woken up. In stop mode only a few peripherals are still in operate mode, in our case the RTC, the RTC backup memory and digital inputs for wakeup signals. Because the content of the RAM gets lost in stop mode, the RTC backup memory has to be utilized for storing permanent data.

With the firmware I tried out some concepts, I first figured out in my mind. The operating system should handle tasks event based. The operating system is also used to create a barrier between hardware and logic implementation. Peripherals will trigger a hardware interrupt routine, which only does short handling of startus flags and will trigger the os to put an event into a fifo. After that the scheduler will take over and notify each task, which has registered for that event type. The logic is implemented as tasks. For example decoding the DCF frame is a task and driving the LEDs is a task. Each task can register its observable events. Multiple tasks can register for the same event, so multi tasks will be notified on that specific event. Each tasks has its own state (wake, sleep, deepsleep). The operating system will only go into sleep or stop mode, if all tasks are in the corresponding state. The operating state of peripherals are handled by the operating system, too. Peripherals will only go into operate mode, if they are requested so. And peripherals will be powered down, if no task need it anymore. That allows the lowest amount of energy to be used for the specific use case.

Manufacturing the PCB was quite fun. This was my first project in which I tried to reflow the assembled PCB. The solder paste was applied with an old credit card for extra style.

The result came out quite good.
