At the flea market, we bought a buggy board for our stroller. The buggy board looked well-preserved, except for a few signs of wear. However, maneuvering with the board wasn't very easy, as the steering axles of the board were somewhat stiff.

Once home, we took a closer look at the board and then disassembled it. It turned out that the axle socket, made of plastic, was broken.

The swivel caster was rubbing against the axle socket, which caused visible scratch marks on both sides of the plastic.

The repair was relatively simple. It involved using a washer as a spacer and greasing the axle with lubricating grease.
